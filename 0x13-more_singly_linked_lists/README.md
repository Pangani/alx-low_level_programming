What is Data Structure:

A data structure is a storage that is used to store and organize data. It is a way of arranging data on a computer so that it can be accessed and updated efficiently.

A data structure is not only used for organizing the data. It is also used for processing, retrieving, and storing data. There are different basic and advanced types of data structures that are used in almost every program or software system that has been developed. So we must have good knowledge about data structures.

Representation of Linked Lists: 

A linked list is represented by a pointer to the first node of the linked list. The first node is called the head of the linked list. If the linked list is empty, then the value of the head points to NULL. 

Each node in a list consists of at least two parts: 

A Data Item (we can store integer, strings, or any type of data).
Pointer (Or Reference) to the next node (connects one node to another) or An address of another node
